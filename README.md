# Phishing Email Simulation Program  

The **Phishing Email Simulation Program** is a cybersecurity training tool designed to simulate real-world phishing attacks in a safe, controlled environment. It leverages **AI-generated content** to craft realistic phishing emails with embedded malicious links or attachments. This program is ideal for **cybersecurity awareness campaigns, red team exercises, and phishing defense training** in academic and organizational setups.

## 🏗️ System Workflow   
1. **Email Content Generation** – AI models generate phishing email text tailored to realistic scenarios.  
2. **Malicious Embedding** – Links or attachments are injected into the generated email.  
3. **Delivery via Email Service** – The crafted phishing email is sent using a valid SMTP/email service.  
4. **User Interaction Logging** – Tracks clicks, downloads, or responses for awareness assessment.  
5. **Reporting & Analysis** – Provides reports on success rates, attack trends, and recommendations.
